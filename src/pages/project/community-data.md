I wasnâ€™t in a technical role at Udacity, but it was a scrappy startup, so if you wanted something done it almost always meant doing it yourself. I ended up creating a data pipeline to collect information that I needed and fed it into a cloud database from which I could build dashboards for my own reporting needs.
