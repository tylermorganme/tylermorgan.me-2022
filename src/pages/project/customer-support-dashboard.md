When the customer support team at Udacity had to adjust customer payments, they had to go through the interfaces of external tools. This process often meant manually parsing through hundreds of transactions to then modify dozens of them one by one. I programmed interfaces in some existing internal tools that would allow customer support staff to filter down to the data they needed and adjust the appropriate transactions with the push of a button.
