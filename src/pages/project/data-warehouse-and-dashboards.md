My work at MISOM was primarily being a bridge between frontline operations at the sites we were working with and MISOMâ€™s software and database developers. It was my task to go to sites and identify potential sources of data, as well as document business processes for building data warehouses and business intelligence dashboards. I was doing a lot of the application prototyping in Excel and Access, but the production programming was done by a team of developers.
