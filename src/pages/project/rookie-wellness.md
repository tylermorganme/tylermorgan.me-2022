My friends over at Polyhorse were working with an online retailer that needed to tune up their Shopify site. Several different developers had hacked various functionality into a theme that Rookie purchased and the technical debt was starting to show. I was brought in to help them tidy up a bunch of loose threads in the styling of the site and to rework their product views and checkout process to feel more seamless on mobile. I was able to deliver everything they asked for, on time, and ultimately was able to pay off a bit of that technical debt.
