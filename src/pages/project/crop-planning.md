In 2021 my partner and I started talking about starting a farm and as part of that process we had to come up with a crop plan. Of course, the first place I went was Excel and I built a monster of a spreadsheet that works better than a ever expected, but at some point Excel is too brittle. Cropik was a small slice of a system that would allow a user to easily create planting of certain crops and move them around within a calendar. If youâ€™ve look at my previous projects you are probably starting to see a theme here. I think there is a lot of room for improvement in create data system for managing time information.
