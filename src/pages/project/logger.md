I decided to revisit this idea of a lightweight fleet management system after seven years. Two things drive me nuts about most operations data software:
1. The inputs are wonky.
2. itâ€™s hard to edit data after input.
  
Logger was an attempt to solve the first problem and find an easy way for an operator to make a record of what they were doing in a day.
