The primary purpose of the Blue Glass Farm site was to give customers a place to find information about our site. I knew from the get-go it was going to be image heavy and really wanted it to be performant. I decided to build it in Gatsby to take advantage of their excellent image optimzation and because I wanted to version control all of the site content using markdown files.
