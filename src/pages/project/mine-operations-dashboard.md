While I was working for Rio Tinto, I developed quite a few dashboards for operations, leadership, and engineering. Some of my favorites included:
- Payload reporting tools that allowed them to reduce out-of-compliance load reporting by 51%.
- Shovel operator dashboards that allowed supervisors to see where their best operators were 2X as productive as their least performant operators and easily compare the performance between shifts.
- Long-term planning tools sped up the process of determining equipment needs by 90% and caught hundreds of errors in our assumptions for production rates.
