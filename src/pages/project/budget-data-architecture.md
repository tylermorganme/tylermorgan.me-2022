A good friend from one of the largest gold companies in the world said they were having trouble getting some of their software to communicate together. The software that they did their operations budgets in was siloed from the business analysis team that would eventually make decision on greenlighting project. I worked with them to architect a solution that would allow them to build their budgets in a way that could be consumed by the analytics team. This data would then flow digitally through a series of check steps to the final consumer. I didn’t actually handle implementation of the system, rather I worked with their internal team to help them understand the scope of work and smooth out communications between mining personnel and their technical teams. So often I find the issues internal teams have when working with their IT departments is they just don’t know the right things to ask for.
