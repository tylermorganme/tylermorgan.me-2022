A good friend from one of the largest gold companies in the world said they were having trouble getting some of their software to communicate together. The software that they created their operations budgets in was siloed from the business analysis team that would eventually make decisions on greenlighting the project. I worked with them to architect a solution that would allow them to build their budgets in a way that could be consumed by the analytics team. This data would then flow digitally through a series of check steps to the final consumer. I insisted that their internal BI teams create the solution to make sure ownership would be maintained once they no longer needed my services. I worked with their internal team to help them understand the scope of work and smooth out communications between mining personnel and their technical teams. So often I find the issues internal teams have when working with their IT departments is they just donâ€™t know the right things to ask for.
