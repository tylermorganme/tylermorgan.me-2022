OperationSuite was a project built for a large aggregate mine in Arizona. The app allows users to input all of their operations data, blend it into a consistent data system, and provided lightweight reporting. This is the largest application Iâ€™ve ever built. I made the backend using Hasura, set up all the auth and an admin for managing auth using Auth0, build the frontend as a react app, and heavily customized a data adapter to make react-admin play nicely with the way I was storing data in Hasura. I loved this tech stack and plan to revisit it in the future.
