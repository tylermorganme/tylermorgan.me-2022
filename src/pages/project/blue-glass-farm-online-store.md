When we started our farm we knew that we might want to build out an online store at some point. In a last minute decision we decided to kick off the store at the end of the 2022 farm season and that meant standing the site up in week. We implemented the new Local Pick and Delivery system, heavily customized one of the brand new 2.0 themes, and even built a custom Jupyter Notebook based data pipeline to create reports from the GraphQL Admin API that enabled us to efficiently fulfill orders.
